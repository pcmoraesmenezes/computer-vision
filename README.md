# Computer Vision

## Introduction

This repository contains a study on computer vision theme, with a focus on image processing and object detection. The main goal is to learn and apply the concepts of computer vision in a practical way, using Python and OpenCV.

## OCR

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that converts a text image into a legible machine-encoded text. 

To use OCR, we need to:

1. Image acquisition

2. Preprocessing 

3. Pattern recognition

4. Resourcing   

One of the best OCR libraries is Tesseract, which is an open-source OCR engine developed by Google.
