### Morphological Transformations: Erosion and Dilation

Morphological transformations are operations used to process images based on the structure or shape of objects. These transformations are mainly used for refining or modifying binary images (images with only black and white pixels). Two of the most important morphological operations are **erosion** and **dilation**.

#### Erosion
Erosion is an operation that reduces the size of objects in a binary image. It removes pixels from the boundaries of objects.

- **How it works**: 
  - A small shape called a **structuring element** (e.g., square or circle) is moved over the image.
  - If the structuring element fits entirely within the object (i.e., all pixels are white), the pixel in the center remains white; otherwise, it turns black.
  - This process **shrinks the boundaries** of objects and reduces their size.

- **Applications**:
  - Removing small noise or particles from the image.
  - Separating connected components in an image.

#### Dilation
Dilation is the opposite of erosion. It increases the size of objects by adding pixels to the boundaries.

- **How it works**: 
  - A structuring element is moved over the image.
  - If at least one pixel in the structuring element is white, the center pixel becomes white.
  - This process **expands the boundaries** of objects and increases their size.

- **Applications**:
  - Filling small holes or gaps inside objects.
  - Connecting separate objects or components.

#### Difference between Erosion and Dilation

- **Erosion**: Shrinks objects and removes small regions.
- **Dilation**: Expands objects and fills in gaps.

These operations are often used together to refine images. For example, dilation can be applied first to enlarge objects, and then erosion can be used to remove noise.
